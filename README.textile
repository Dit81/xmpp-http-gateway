A simple bot which exposes HTTP verbs over XMPP. Currently only 
really useful for HTTP debugging. I plan to add a few new features as time permits:

* Adding a custom header to the request for user agent detection
* Allow sending of data for relevant methods
* Provide access to headers as well as content
* Provide a mechanism to register processors for responses, for instance validation routines or test searches

h2. Requirements

You'll need a couple of external libraries to make everything work correctly and deal with the low level XMPP bits.

# xmpppy - http://xmpppy.sourceforge.net/
# JabberBot - http://thpinfo.com/2007/python-jabberbot/
# Python REST Client - http://code.google.com/p/python-rest-client/

Either place these in the same directory as the included files or elsewhere on your Python Path.

h2. Running

# Specify your username and password in the settings.py file.
# Run the daemon.py command without any arguments.

<pre>python daemon.py</pre>

h2. Thanks
